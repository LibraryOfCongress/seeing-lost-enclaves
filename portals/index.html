  <p>Hello and welcome. I‚Äôm <a href="https://unterbahn.com">Jeffrey Yoo Warren</a>, the 2023-24 Library of Congress Innovator in Residence.</p>

  <p>At the sites of 5 historical erased Asian American communities, portals have been hidden in plain sight. When you approach, the portals will open, allowing a glimpse into virtually reconstructed, immersive moments from their pasts.</p> 

<p>
<a onClick="scrollAcross('providence')" href="javascript:void(0);">Providence</a> | 
<a onClick="scrollAcross('portland')" href="javascript:void(0);">Portland</a> |

<a onClick="scrollAcross('truckee')" href="javascript:void(0);">Truckee</a>
and <a onClick="scrollAcross('sites','start')" href="javascript:void(0);">at the Library of Congress</a>
</p>

  <p>As a part of my residency project, <a href="https://libraryofcongress.github.io/seeing-lost-enclaves/">Seeing Lost Enclaves</a>, portals have also been created in and around the Library of Congress in Washington, DC. My collaborators and I have spent the past two years crafting these portals from archival records, photographs, oral histories and other clues. Our experiences sifting through archival clues have also revealed how these stories have been historically hidden.</p>

  <p>The worlds we've re-constructed are, by necessity, partial, fleeting and speculative to varying degrees. In the spirit of Saidiya Hartman‚Äôs critical fabulation and the speculative fiction of Linda Sue Park, we have focused on the sensory experiences of place ‚Äì those knowledges most likely to survive by remaining hidden ‚Äì rather than the dates and historical facts. By placing these portals ‚Äì these reconstructions of lost enclaves ‚Äì in unmarked spots, I hope they will resist denials, misunderstandings, exoticizing gazes, and re-displacement, through their insubstantial and ghostly presence, impossible to drive out.</p>

  <h2 id="history">How we got here</h2>

  <p>Beginning in the 1870s, Chinese Americans across the west coast were violently driven from their homes by racist groups such as the Caucasian League, often with the support or involvement of city officials and courts of law. In my work, I'm seeking to reconnect Asian Americans with a time when we were profoundly unwelcome, but these harms are not the main focus of my work. Rather, by reconstructing the textures and stories of their lives, and immersing ourselves in the worlds of these long-ago communities, we can better understand ourselves and the more just and joyful futures we are crafting today. Each of these sites is also on the land of <a href="#land">Native tribes and peoples</a>.</p>

  <p>Step 1: Visit <a href="#sites">one of the sites</a>, and <b>open this website</b> on your phone.</p>

  <img src="sites/2.png" alt="An illustration of a hand holding a vibrating mobile phone" />
  <p>Step 2: As you approach, the text of the website will begin to jitter, indicating that you‚Äôre near a portal. A slight vibration may also happen.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <img src="sites/3.png" alt="An illustration of a hand holding a mobile phone with a dark circle in the center of the screen, representing a portal opening" />
  <p>Step 3: Approach to within 30 feet of the marked spot; keep the website open on your phone as you approach. A circular image will appear on your screen, and sounds will begin to play. If you don't see anything, try refreshing the page.</p>
  <p>Step 4: Click the circle to enter the portal.</p>
  <p>Step 5: Turn up the volume and/or use headphones.</p>

  <p>Step 6: Look around, using your phone as a window to see the reconstructed community.</p>

  <p>Providence had a vibrant Chinese American neighborhood on both Burrill Street and Empire Street between c1880-1914, but successive displacements pushed the community out of downtown by 1914.</p>
  <p>Some in the community were escaping racist violence across the West Coast, including Taw Foo, who moved from Portland, and grew heritage vegetables on a plot outside of town. The community included musicians, chefs, pharmacists, and members of a local church choir. Tucked into small private alleys were a tea shop, several groceries, and a restaurant called Yick‚Äôs.</p>

  <p>On the west side of Portland, at the present site of the Multnomah Athletic Club and Lincoln High School, a small farming village lived along the banks of Tanner Creek from the 1870s through the early 1900s. Today it is covered by many feet of infill, but by 1900, dozens of small buildings clustered on the hill overlooking the creek, where you could see crops growing in lush fields on the steep hillsides, and clothes hung out to dry.</p>

  <p>The Taoist Temple is still stewarded by descendants of the neighborhood called China Alley in Hanford, California. As artist Evelyn Yin writes: "The town of Hanford was formed in 1877 when the Southern Pacific Railroad extended into California's San Joaquin Valley. Many Chinese laborers came to work on the tracks and later stayed for farming. They were mostly from Sam Yup (‰∏âÈÇë sƒÅny√¨), the three former counties of Namhoi (ÂçóÊµ∑ n√°nh«éi), Poonyu (Áï™Á¶∫ pƒÅny√∫) and Shuntak (È°∫Âæ∑ sh√πnd√©) in Canton ‚Äî now known as Gu«éngd≈çng Âπø‰∏ú ‚Äî province. China Alley prospered to include restaurants, homes, boarding houses, general merchandise stores, herb shops, gambling establishments, a Chinese school, and a temple. Over 100 years later, the brick buildings remain largely intact and unaltered."</p>

  <p>In 1908, Pachappa Camp was established in Riverside, CA during the beginning of the occupation of Korea by the Empire of Japan and played a role in independence organizing by early Korean Americans. Families built a small community and earned money by picking citrus. Photos of residents include children playing baseball and track, riding bicycles, learning trumpet and playing among the chrysanthemums the community grew.</p>

  <p>In 1870, more than a quarter of the population of Truckee was Chinese American, and a bustling Chinatown included 11 groceries, as well as tea shops, doctor‚Äôs offices, gardens, and a bath house.</p> 
  <p>Truckee‚Äôs Chinatowns were subject to racist treatment and were burnt down repeatedly until 1886, when most Chinese Americans left. Some relocated to Oroville and other areas, where they found relative safety and prosperity. Today, descendants of the Fong Lee family business in Truckee continue to trace their history back over 140 generations and still remember their years in Truckee and the home they were able to make there.</p>

  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <h3>Is this a historical project?</h3>

  <p>Not exactly, no ‚Äì¬†my work builds on historical records and stories but as an artist, my broader goal is to connect present-day Asian Americans with the some of the earliest histories of Asian Americans in this country. I'm more interested in how we build relationships with these pasts and how we imagine more just futures, than in the precision of the reproductions.</p>

  <h3>How was this project created?</h3>

  <p>Read more about the background and history of this project at the <a href="https://libraryofcongress.github.io/seeing-lost-enclaves/">Seeing Lost Enclaves website</a></p>

<!--

  <p>What collections were used in this project?</p>

<li>A wide variety of resources from LOC were used to create these reconstructions, in addition to local and family archives and histories. Some examples include:
<li>Sanborn insurance maps
<li>Many items from Prints & Photos
<li>AAPI Community Collection (formerly Asian Division, now Manuscripts)
