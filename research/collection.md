# Source Set Collection

As part of the first mileston of the _Seeing Lost Enclaves_ project, I've compiled a collection of free to use images, films and maps from the Library of Congress for download. These represent just a small selection of the materials available at the Library of Congress cited in the [bibliography](/research/bibliography.md) (additional public domain images are also available which have not yet been digitized), and even more are available from non-LOC sources. The following include images and maps from Truckee, CA, New Orleans, LA, Deadwood, SD, and a variety from other Chinatowns and erased communities of color around the country.
