# Seeing Lost Enclaves
### Relational reconstructions of erased historic neighborhoods of color

A project by [Jeffrey Yoo Warren](https://unterbahn.com)

_This is a draft website. The final will be published at the end of December 2022._

This is a guide to finding and gathering clues to places which have been erased; neighborhoods and communities who were not included in archives during their time, and whose traces we can find mostly through the in-between glimpses, the cracks and gaps, the unsaid and the hidden away. Most of what we find through this process is not the real story. It’s the selective forgetting, overwriting, and reshaping of histories, *despite* which we will try to see people, their spaces, and the things they cared about.

It's the first part of an evolving guide to [relational reconstruction](relational-reconstruction.md), a set of practices for creating an immersive (virtual, 3D) reconstruction of an erased neighborhood, such as the one I have begun to craft in the [Seeing Providence Chinatown project](https://unterbahn.com/chinatown), about the neighborhood which existed on Empire Street in Providence, RI until December 1914. 

This guide will continue to grow and change as the project emerges. 

## What kind of project is this?

This project, and the [relational reconstruction](relational-reconstruction.md) methodology I envision, is focused on memory, remembrance, and personal relationships to histories. It is not a work of history or formal archiving (see "Is this a precise historic recreation?" in the [FAQ](faq.md)), but a way for us to reckon with the past and its meanings to us today and in the future, in personal terms.

Think of this as a journey through these materials which you can chart with love, perhaps guiding your community around the hazards and pitfalls of the archival lens, to be close with – to share space with – histories and spaces which we often must glimpse through the cracks. 

It's a meditation, the searching. Handling these artifacts with tenderness. Not picking them apart like meat from a bone or gems from the soil. Gathering them together with gentle hands. Healing yourself as you glimpse them. Giving them recognition, and rest.

### A note of caution

To those beginning to look through these histories: please take care of yourself. In this work, you’ll come across material which will be painful to read, including violence, but also the diminution of violence – even from present day historians and archivists. There will be people who don’t understand this pain or how they can add to it. Take breaks and deep breaths. Listen to something calming. The kind of justice we seek in relational reconstruction is through remembrance and connection. It may be someone else’s important work to hold themselves accountable for these acts. It may even be yours on another occasion, but our goal here and now is to see beyond those painful parts to try to connect with people’s lives; people who might be your ancestors, or who walked a path your ancestors would later.

## Seeing Providence Chinatown

This research guide comes out of initial work in [Seeing Providence Chinatown](https://unterbahn.com/chinatown). In thinking about my approach in that project, I wrote:

I hope to produce a more immersive and contextually complete record by way of a spatial and sensory reconstruction, which will enable audiences to experience in a richer and more personal way what it would have felt like to stand in the heart of Providence's Chinatown and other erased enclaves of color. Our histories include traumas – my ancestors were not allowed into the US until 1965, and the early history of Asian Americans in Providence was also fraught with exoticization – like Chinese performer Afong Moy’s 1835 appearance as a curiosity in the Providence Museum. These histories are over-represented in the archive.

By contrast, my goal is to use the process of reconstruction as one of healing and of belonging, and as a reclaiming and re-contextualizing of the archive and its meanings for our futures, inspired by the speculative futurity projects of contemporary Black artists and the idea of critical fabulation developed by Saidiya Hartman. My practice engages peoples’ creative and collaborative abilities, building tools and spaces which support and inspire creative practices, and the Relational Reconstruction Toolkit focuses on the creative possibilities of what it could have felt like –as an Asian American person – to walk down the street and experience a sense of belonging at that moment in history.
