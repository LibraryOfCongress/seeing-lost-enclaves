# Bibliography

This bibliography is compiled from an early search through Library of Congress collections, in which I focused on several candidate sites to better understand the search process, the availability of records, and the histories of different Chinatowns and other sites. It is not meant as a comprehensive listing of Library of Congress materials, and I will continue adding to it. If you have items to contribute please reach out; thank you.

For a bibliography of [Providence's Chinatown](https://unterbahn.com/chinatown), which I originally compiled before the start of this residency, I plan to expand on it with Library of Congress items and include it at a later time. 


<!-- Only Chinatowns? No, but explain. Research into lost and erased enclaves of color, with a focus on Chinatowns. -->

<!-- Only Library of Congress? No, but explain. -->

## Starting points

Navigating the many divisions, collections, finding aids, guides, and search systems of the Library of Congress has been a challenge, even as the breadth of the library holds many possibilities. The following are a selection of collections, tools, services, and other starting points for research into lost enclaves of color, with a focus on Chinatowns.
