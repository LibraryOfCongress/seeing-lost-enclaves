# Bibliography

This bibliography is compiled from an early search through Library of Congress collections, in which I focused on several candidate sites to better understand the search process, the availability of records, and the histories of different Chinatowns and other sites. It is not meant as a comprehensive listing of Library of Congress materials, and I will continue adding to it. If you have items to contribute please reach out; thank you.
