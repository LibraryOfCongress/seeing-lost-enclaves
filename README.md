# Seeing Lost Enclaves
### Relational reconstructions of erased historic neighborhoods of color

Seeing Lost Enclaves is a [project] (https://newsroom.loc.gov/news/2023-innovator-in-residence-rebuilds-and-revisits-lost-communities/s/33e910fb-0ea2-4676-ba4c-0ce15e664735) by [Jeffrey Yoo Warren](https://unterbahn.com) as part of the 2023 [Innovator in Residence Program](https://labs.loc.gov/about/opportunities/innovator-in-residence-program) at the [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/).

_This is a draft guide. The final will be published in September 2023 on the [LC Labs website] (https://labs.loc.gov/work/experiments/lost-enclaves)._

This repository contains the documentation for the Seeing Lost Enclaves project. **Part 1: Research** will be posted in draft form in December 2022.

The files contained can be viewed individually but are cross-linked as well:

* [Research](research/index.md) contains Part 1 and is online in draft form; locating reference materials for relational reconstruction.
    * See the [bibliography here](research/bibliography.md)
    * See an initial source set of public domain Library of Congress materials [here](research/collection.md)
* **Reconstruction** will cover the development of modeling textures from source and reference images.
* **Modeling** will cover crafting 3D buildings and mapping reconstructed facades and textures onto them.
* **Soundscapes** will cover developing audio soundscapes from archival and reference recordings.
* **Ambience** will cover generating ambient effects, lighting and weather within reconstructed scenes.
