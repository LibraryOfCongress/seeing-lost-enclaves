The files contained can be viewed individually but are cross-linked as well:

* [Research](research/index.md) contains Part 1 and is online in draft form; locating reference materials for relational reconstruction.
* **Reconstruction** will cover the development of modeling textures from source and reference images.
* **Modeling** will cover crafting 3D buildings and mapping reconstructed facades and textures onto them.
* **Soundscapes** will cover developing audio soundscapes from archival and reference recordings.
* **Ambience** will cover generating ambient effects, lighting and weather within reconstructed scenes.
