# Tracking photos

In researching Providence's Chinatown, I found that I quickly collected dozens, and eventually hundreds, of photos, as well as web pages and archives I needed to follow up on. Tracking where each one came from, which I wanted to return to for a more detailed look, and anything else about the images, quickly became a challenge. 

I'm sharing access to my original spreadsheet so you can see how I organized my record keeping, and will also share templates (below) which you can use to organize your own. You don't have to use my system, but I'll share how it works and why.

First, it's a working document, not a formal bibliography, so my priority was recording as much as I could, but it's not a "perfect" document, whatever that means.
