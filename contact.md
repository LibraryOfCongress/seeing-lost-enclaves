I’m beginning to reach out to folks about helping with reconstruction project in other places. Recently I spent time looking for records in Truckee, CA, New Orleans, Deadwood, SD, and other places, and have been collaborating with [Dri Chiu Tattersfield](https://hellodri.itch.io/) *![external link](../images/external-link.gif)*.

I’m interested in connecting with descendants of these communities, as well as with Asian American artists, historians, and community members interested in remembrance related to these places.
