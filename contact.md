This toolkit represents work I did from 2022-2024 as the Library of Congress Innovator in Residence. I continue to be interested in connecting with descendants of these communities, as well as with Asian American artists, historians, and community members interested in remembrance related to these places. As I continue the work I began during this project, you can follow me at:

Please send questions about the Innovator in Residence program and other Library of Congress matters to LC-Labs@loc.gov.
