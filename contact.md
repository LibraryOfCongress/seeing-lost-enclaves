I’m beginning to reach out to folks about – slowly – beginning a reconstruction project in other places. Recently I spent time looking for records in Truckee, CA, New Orleans, Deadwood, SD, and other places.

I’m interested in connecting with descendants of these communities, as well as with Asian American artists, historians, and community members interested in remembrance related to these places.
