# Related work / inspirations

In the spirit of a "Constellation of Inspirations" ([Alice Yuan Zhang](https://aliceyuanzhang.com/)), here are a range of people, projects, writings, and ideas which have inspired and shaped my work:


> [We Still Canâ€™t See American Slavery for What It Was](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/28/opinion/slavery-voyages-data-sets.html), by Jamelle Bouie, discusses the limitations of understanding the lives of those enslaved during the trans-Atlantic slave trade through data-driven records and the accounts by enslavers.

> [Venus in Two Acts](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/427132), by Saidiya Hartman (content warning: extreme violence and dehumanization) 

> [Prarie Lotus](https://lindasuepark.com/books/books-novels/prairie-lotus/) by Linda Sue Park, is accompanied, on her website, by a Native American resource guide compiled by author and educator Andrea Page (Oceti Sakowin Hunkpapa), about the Oceti Sakowin people of the area in which the book is set.
