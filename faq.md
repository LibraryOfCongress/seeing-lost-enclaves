# Frequently Asked Questions



## Is this a precise historic recreation? How is precision communicated?

No - my goal in relational reconstruction has been to use the process of reconstruction as one of healing and of belonging, and as a reclaiming and re-contextualizing of the archive and its meanings for our futures, inspired by Saidiya Hartman's _critical fabulation_ (also see Venus in Two Acts, cited in [Inspirations](inspirations.md)). My practice engages peoples’ creative and collaborative abilities, building tools and spaces which support and inspire creative practices, and the Relational Reconstruction Toolkit focuses on the creative possibilities of what it could have felt like –as an Asian American person – to walk down the street and experience a sense of belonging at that moment in history.
