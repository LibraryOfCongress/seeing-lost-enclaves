# Seeing Lost Enclaves
### Relational reconstructions of erased historic neighborhoods of color

Seeing Lost Enclaves is a project by [Jeffrey Yoo Warren](https://unterbahn.com) as part of the 2023 [Innovator in Residence Program](https://labs.loc.gov/about/opportunities/innovator-in-residence-program) at the [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/).

_This is a draft. The final version will be published in September 2023._ This guide will continue to grow and change as the project emerges. 

[Part 1: Research](research/)

Part 1 is the first part of an evolving guide to [relational reconstruction](relational-reconstruction.md), a set of practices for creating an immersive (virtual, 3D) reconstruction of an erased neighborhood, such as the one I have begun to craft in the [Seeing Providence Chinatown project](https://unterbahn.com/chinatown), about the neighborhood which existed on Empire Street in Providence, RI until December 1914.

## Seeing Providence Chinatown

This research guide comes out of initial work in [Seeing Providence Chinatown](https://unterbahn.com/chinatown). In thinking about my approach in that project, I wrote:

I hope to produce a more immersive and contextually complete record by way of a spatial and sensory reconstruction, which will enable audiences to experience in a richer and more personal way what it would have felt like to stand in the heart of Providence's Chinatown and other erased enclaves of color. Our histories include traumas – my ancestors were not allowed into the US until 1965, and the early history of Asian Americans in Providence was also fraught with exoticization – like Chinese performer Afong Moy’s 1835 appearance as a curiosity in the Providence Museum. These histories are over-represented in the archive.

By contrast, my goal is to use the process of reconstruction as one of healing and of belonging, and as a reclaiming and re-contextualizing of the archive and its meanings for our futures, inspired by the speculative futurity projects of contemporary Black artists and the idea of critical fabulation developed by Saidiya Hartman. My practice engages peoples’ creative and collaborative abilities, building tools and spaces which support and inspire creative practices, and the Relational Reconstruction Toolkit focuses on the creative possibilities of what it could have felt like –as an Asian American person – to walk down the street and experience a sense of belonging at that moment in history.
