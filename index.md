# Seeing Lost Enclaves

A project by [Jeffrey Yoo Warren](https://unterbahn.com)

This is a guide to finding and gathering clues to places which have been erased; neighborhoods and communities who were not included in archives during their time, and whose traces we can find mostly through the in-between glimpses, the cracks and gaps, the unsaid and the hidden away. Most of what we find through this process is not the real story. Itâ€™s the selective forgetting, overwriting, and reshaping of histories, *despite* which we will try to see people, their spaces, and the things they cared about.
