# Seeing Lost Enclaves

A project by [Jeffrey Yoo Warren](https://unterbahn.com)

This is a guide to finding and gathering clues to places which have been erased; neighborhoods and communities who were not included in archives during their time, and whose traces we can find mostly through the in-between glimpses, the cracks and gaps, the unsaid and the hidden away. Most of what we find through this process is not the real story. It’s the selective forgetting, overwriting, and reshaping of histories, *despite* which we will try to see people, their spaces, and the things they cared about.
